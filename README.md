## Please cite this work if you use any codes in your work.


Mobile network based models are proposed for making smaller models for segmentation of left ventricle of the heart in the short axis view and  compared with state of the art techniques for ultrasound imaging. We compared our models with other state of the art techniques such as UNet, MiniNetV2,
and FCdDN and compared our models in terms of size, number of parameters as well as the various figures of merit. 

## Contributions :
We proposed a novel architecture named LVNet which gives a better tradeoff between the number of parameters and the segmentation performance.

A new pipeline is proposed for training the models and also for the post-processing of the results.

Segmentation was done for two different structures and the proposed method gave better performance than other architectures.
